# Mia

This is an actor implementation of the popular German drinking game *Meiern*.
It is also known by different names such as Mäxchen or Mäxle.
For more information on the game have a look at [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meier).

The current implementation in mia.scala is just a first draft and has to be refined.


## Next steps

On the long run, mia should run distributed.
So a setup phase is needed as outlined in Mia2.scala.
